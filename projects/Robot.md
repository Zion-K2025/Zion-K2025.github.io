This project was during one of my previous engineering classes, Mechanical Engineering 213. The goal was to build a functioing robot using Audino. the goal of the project was to retrieve an egg at a given position while ascending and descending a flight of stairs without breaked the delivery package(said egg). The first step was determing how are we going to grab the egg without breaking it, taking into account the distance ascending up the stairs and down the stairs. We decided in creating 3d printed parts, designing a claw structure for the retrieval. Through the program onshape, we created our design, while making designated slots for the motor to spin, giving the claw the ability to open and close.

THE STRUCTURE
<br/>
For the structure or the chassis of the robot we used metal c-channels. We connected the channels with bolts, although realistically the idea was better on paper then, the actual build. The plan of the build was to mount 3d printed gears so that it can sit on tracks similar to tanks. Unfortunatenly, the time it took to retrieve the parts were incorrect and our team had to quickly change our inital design for something obtainable in a short amount of time. The claw was attached through a c-channel, a stabilizer arm, to help with the claw function. The tracks were replaced with duct-tape wheels. At first glace it was not elegant in comparison to other designs that we looked at but in terms of function. it worked.
