The 'Ike Wai program is a combination of an advanced placement course learning both Calculus 1 which would be counted as college credits and Data Science. During the program, The professors introduced us to r-code. I learned data science by using Data camp which UH Hilo sponsored. The expectation was to input Well data provided by the USGS into an excel sheet, upload the inputs into r-code and create graphs to compare the level of chloride between multiple wells, while comming up with conclusions of the reason for the cause elevate chloride in certain areas.

I worked in a group of 3 to split the amount of entries that needed to be inputed. There was well over 3000 entries. each entry with varying information. Once all entries were completed in excel, all data was transfered into our r-code program allowing my team to plot graphs and compare information between each year of gathered and data and their locations.
