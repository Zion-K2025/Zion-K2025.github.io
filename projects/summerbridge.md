summary: "The 'Ike Wai Summer Bridge is a extensive program for students in Stem to learn Data Science and Mathematics. Student will apply these skills into a student project by calculating the amount of chloride in wells on the island of Hawaii."

The 'Ike Wai program is a combination of an advanced placement course learning both Calculus 1 which would be counted as college credits and Data Science. During the program, The professors introduced us to r-code. I learned data science by using Data camp which UH Hilo sponsored. The expectation was to input Well data provided by the USGS into an excel sheet, upload the inputs into r-code and create graphs to compare the level of chloride between multiple wells, while comming up with conclusions of the reason of the cause for elevated chloride in certain areas.  
<br/>
The program was 2 months. Every day we had a class for 4 hourse learning Calculus and the other 4 hours we worked on the data entries for the upcoming presentation of the Well project. The learning curve was intensive, while the program was held through the day and afternoon, at night I had homework for mathematics and learning the applications for Data science. At the end of the program, My team presented our findings, We created graphs that is shown on the top of this page and explained why chloride level were elevated. We concluded the chloride increased during the summer due to the heat, areas like south of Hawaii Island experienced the elvation levels because the concentration would increase when water levels decrease.
