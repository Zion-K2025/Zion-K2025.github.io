<h1>Software Development and all it's Dificulties</h1>
<p>
  This is my first experience with Software Development. Before this class, I assumed the material would be about the actual
  physical software of a computer, learning how to troubleshoot viruses or bugs, even do some cyber security. Even the first weeks
  of ICS 314, Learning the basic of type script, it seemed to be another class similar to ICS 211 or Some computer programing class
  we would use in some abstract way in the future. But I was completely wrong when we started bootstrap5 web development, while learning
  and developing our skills in Applications. It was interesting and a different setting when everything you worked to do actually has
  a functiion that you can see and interact with. An important piece to software development is coding standards, how to write code, but
  also to write code, in a clean, legible way. I initially believe TypeScript was an easy version of Java. I had some tough experiences
  with Java and C++. Due to my naive train of thought when I accomplished the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, I believed it was easy but as
  project became more difficult and complex, I quickly retracted my previous thought and realized that this is not as easy as it seems.
  Because of the many layers to a web application, Showing clean code can help increase efficency while helping you with tracing possible
  occuring problems from the development process. Students should take their time with planning how the code should be written and reflect
  on it before submitting the appilication. A key strategy is to break things up into small chunks and re-check all application. It's good
  practice for future work with a team and when coding solo
