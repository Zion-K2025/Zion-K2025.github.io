<h1>Software Development and all it's Dificulties</h1>
<p>
  This is my first experience with Software Development. Before this class, I assumed the material would be about the actual
  physical software of a computer, learning how to troubleshoot viruses or bugs, even do some cyber security. Even the first weeks
  of ICS 314, Learning the basic of type script, it seemed to be another class similar to ICS 211 or Some computer programing class
  we would use in some abstract way in the future. But I was completely wrong when we started bootstrap5 web development, while learning
  and developing our skills in Applications. It was interesting and a different setting when everything you worked to do actually has
  a functiion that you can see and interact with. An important piece to software development is coding standards, how to write code, but
  also to write code, in a clean, legible way. I initially believe TypeScript was an easy version of Java. I had some tough experiences
  with Java and C++. Due to my naive train of thought when I accomplished the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, I believed it was easy but as
  project became more difficult and complex, I quickly retracted my previous thought and realized that this is not as easy as it seems.
  Because of the many layers to a web application, Showing clean code can help increase efficency while helping you with tracing possible
  occuring problems from the development process. Students should take their time with planning how the code should be written and reflect
  on it before submitting the appilication. A key strategy is to break things up into small chunks and re-check all application. It's good
  practice for the future when working with a team and when coding solo

  When the hardest thing I learned when I started creating web pages was the enviorments. Some where easier to understand like ESlint, but the 
  hardest challenge was integrating Database PostGres to my computer enviroment. It took me over 2 weeks, re-downloading SQL to figure
  out how to incorporate into visual studios. I watched countless youtube videos, each video giving advice not pertaining to my problem
  even the use of chatGPT had little to no help when trying to intergrate SQL. One of the lessons, I learned going through this process is asking
  for help. If you spent so much time on a certain aspect of Software Development and when through every avenue to fix the problem and still
  came up short. The best thing to do is ask someone who actually know what their doing. Second thing I learned is sometimes it's okay to 
  struggle for a little bit, Whether it's coding or fixing enviroment for visual studios. Taking your time to figure things out is the best way to 
  learn.

  User-interface frame works was also a challenge, there was a large learning curve when I first started using BootStrap-5 or react. Both are 
similar in function but different in application. When I was presented the WODS for the weekly test, There were many times I falled behind on time 
because I didn't fully understand the material. The user-interface application are the foundation to building and layering out web pages for the customer 
to see and use. I wished I had more time to learning more about these frameworks and I hope that I can learn a get better at these due to the fact
that I could possibly be using these tools for my future career.
