<h1>The Making of Effort Estimates</h1></br>
<p>
  In our project called StudyPalz, Each member had their own way of tracking the amount of time it takes to finish a task.
  M3 was a bit different since the functionality of the project became more complex as each member began to add more layers 
  to application. Some of the work from M2(Milestone 2) was discarded creating extra estimation and extra details that may 
  have not been intended when we first laid out the foundations for the project. Each member timed how much it took to finish
  a certain part of the application. Although, there were some part of the program, an example, "Sessions" which took way more time
  to actually finish, which possibly would skew the actual amount of time that it took to finish. While something smaller like
  "fixing a footer" would only take minutes. The more complex the problem, the less accurate the estimation. if the problem is simple 
  the time would be much more accurate.

<h1>Estimation of Tracking</h1>
<p>
  In my personal opinion, there wasn't any benefit to actually tracking the amount of time a task took. Possibly timing on a general scale
  but the main idea was to finish the project before the due date. Tracking every single nuance seems a bit overboard, and to track time if a
  certain task takes longer than expected, doesn't change as long as the issue of the project being completed, but determining that if the issue is much
  more complex than it was intended would cause tracking to be on the back burner only for the application to be done when it's expected.
