<h1>THe Making of Effort Estimates</h1></br>
<p>
  In our project called StudyPalz, Each member had their own way of tracking the amount of time it takes to finish a task.
  M3 was a bit different since the functionality of the project became more complex as each member began to add more layers 
  to application. Some of the work from M2(Milestone 2) was discarded creating extra estimation and extra details that may 
  have not been intended when we first laid out the foundations for the project. Each member timed how much it took to finish
  a certain part of the application. Although, there were some part of the program, an example, "Sessions" which took way more time
  to actually finish, which possibly would skew the actual amount of time that it took to finish. While something smaller like
  "fixing a footer" would only take minutes. The more complex the problem, the less accurate the estimation. if the problem is simple 
  the time would be much more accurate.
