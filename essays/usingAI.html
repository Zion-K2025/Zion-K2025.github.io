<h1>I. Introduction</h1></br>
<p>
  Artificial intelligence has changed the world in drastic manner. Technology has involved making it more accessible for students, teachers,
and workers on the job. Before, we had to look up answers in books, as the years went on technology progressed letting the internet become the 
new way to garner information. Today, Artifical Intelligence has shaped the way software developers code, helping to discover answers to the 
questions that created obstacles for most. We are living the age of accessability and artificial intelligence will continue to evolve, making goals and 
project easier to achieve. 
</p></br>
<h1>II. Personal Experience with AI</h1>
<p>
  At first, I believed that the use of AI, like ChatGPT hindered my own skills and knowledge as computer science student. I believed that I needed to 
know everything to become proficient, Without any outside resources. But I realized very quickly that, using AI as a starting point or even as a resource
to help develop a project. Ai can be very helpful, although it can be hindering if you rely to much on it. In my ICS314 class, I have used artificial intelligence
to help with answers that left my clueless in vertain aspects
Here are some examples of when I did and did not use AI

1.) Experience WODs e.g. E18</br>
- I used AI minimally, The WODs that I passed, I practiced to become quicker when re-creating projected like Kohana</br>
2.) In-class Practice WODs</br>
- Used AI, Due to the fact that I didn't know the material beforehand.</br>
3.) In-class WODs</br>
- I would use AI, if I found myslef in a tight spot, and don't remember my practice material. </br>
4.) Essays</br>
- No, There was no need for Ai( I dont not use Grammarly)</br>
5.) Final project</br>
- Yes, I used AI for my portion of the project, I needed to create a Calendar. I used as much resources as possible, even on some parts where
I was unassigned and needed a brief idea, how the function would work in type script.</br>
6.) Learning a concept / tutorial</br>
- No, the homework had detailed explanations and guidelines. There wasn't a need for AI</br>
7.) Answering a question in class or in Discord</br>
- No, I did not use Ai to answer questions in Discord</br>
8.) Asking or answering a smart-question</br>
- No, I did my own research and used Youtube to help me solidify an idea for any smart questions that was assigned</br>
9.) Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck</br>
-I have never used Pluck before.</br>
10.) Explaining code</br>
- I Have used Ai to help understand code, but I would try to explain it in my own words.</br>
11.) Writing Code</br>
- Initially, there were some parts where I needed ChatGPT to help me start off with code, especially when using react</br>
12.) Documenting Code</br>
-No, I did not use AI to document code</br>
13.) Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”</br>
-Yes, in this specific example, If I can't find the answer and I need a deeper explanation. </br>
14.) Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</br>
-I have used code to help answer question relatijng to nextjs, and database. Postgress was a difficult subject to understand</br>

<h1>Pros and Cons of the benefits of Tracking Time and Issues</h1>
<p>
  There could be some benefits to tracking, and estimating per task. For example, if there is a deadline, and The company need something
  to be fixed ASAP. It was important for the Software Developer to communicate of the expected outcome. On a personal not, in terms
  for this project. there wasn't really a benefit in time estimation due to the fact. Some of the work, not accurate due to some assigments 
  had to be rolled over into the next day. or if part of the project was previously completed had bugs, The estimation would be skewed 
  And the developer would have to retrack the amount of time that it would take to fix the bug. But admittendly, Some Team member put in much
  more work in comparison to others. I can honestly state, that the amount of effort I put in was less in comparison to my teammates, due to the 
  fact there was a lot of complex layers that was developed after M2. Which limited the amount of help I could provide. While the estimation
  for my teammates are much higher. They deserve most of the credit due to effort and time put into the project, While I could only help
  on small nuances and testing. 
</p></br>
<h1>How to track effort</h1>
<p>
  I was able to track my effort through using a stop watch on my phone, While my teammates used there laptock to check for time, and discord presence
  some where estimated(the complex problems like Sessions). </br></br>
  In terms of Accuracy, I believe the smaller issues where easily trackable with minimum error while the larger problems which took a couple days
  to finish is estimated, and not exact.
