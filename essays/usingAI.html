<h1>I. Introduction</h1></br>
<p>
  Artificial intelligence has changed the world in drastic manner. Technology has involved making it more accessible for students, teachers,
and workers on the job. Before, we had to look up answers in books, as the years went on technology progressed letting the internet become the 
new way to garner information. Today, Artifical Intelligence has shaped the way software developers code, helping to discover answers to the 
questions that created obstacles for most. We are living the age of accessability and artificial intelligence will continue to evolve, making goals and 
project easier to achieve. 
</p></br>
<h1>II. Personal Experience with AI</h1>
<p>
  At first, I believed that the use of AI, like ChatGPT hindered my own skills and knowledge as computer science student. I believed that I needed to 
know everything to become proficient, Without any outside resources. But I realized very quickly that, using AI as a starting point or even as a resource
to help develop a project. Ai can be very helpful, although it can be hindering if you rely to much on it. In my ICS314 class, I have used artificial intelligence
to help with answers that left my clueless in vertain aspects
Here are some examples of when I did and did not use AI</br></br>

1.) Experience WODs e.g. E18</br>
- I used AI minimally, The WODs that I passed, I practiced to become quicker when re-creating projected like Kohana</br>
2.) In-class Practice WODs</br>
- Used AI, Due to the fact that I didn't know the material beforehand.</br>
3.) In-class WODs</br>
- I would use AI, if I found myslef in a tight spot, and don't remember my practice material. </br>
4.) Essays</br>
- No, There was no need for Ai( I dont not use Grammarly)</br>
5.) Final project</br>
- Yes, I used AI for my portion of the project, I needed to create a Calendar. I used as much resources as possible, even on some parts where
I was unassigned and needed a brief idea, how the function would work in type script.</br>
6.) Learning a concept / tutorial</br>
- No, the homework had detailed explanations and guidelines. There wasn't a need for AI</br>
7.) Answering a question in class or in Discord</br>
- No, I did not use Ai to answer questions in Discord</br>
8.) Asking or answering a smart-question</br>
- No, I did my own research and used Youtube to help me solidify an idea for any smart questions that was assigned</br>
9.) Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck</br>
-I have never used Pluck before.</br>
10.) Explaining code</br>
- I Have used Ai to help understand code, but I would try to explain it in my own words.</br>
11.) Writing Code</br>
- Initially, there were some parts where I needed ChatGPT to help me start off with code, especially when using react</br>
12.) Documenting Code</br>
-No, I did not use AI to document code</br>
13.) Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code?” or “Fix the ESLint errors”</br>
-Yes, in this specific example, If I can't find the answer and I need a deeper explanation. </br>
14.) Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</br>
-I have used code to help answer question relatijng to nextjs, and database. Postgress was a difficult subject to understand</br>
</br>

<h1>III. Impact of Learning and Understanding</h1>
<p>
  Artificial Intelligence is resource, It help with use for multiple aspects but in my personal opinion when it came specifically for software development
  It was good as a starting basis when you need or a framework. I have used AI as skeleton, so that when I start developing to become more layered, I can build upon
  it, and make it more of my style of coding vs fully computer. The second usage, is great for problem solving. There have been issues, especially in the final 
  project where I came across no ES lint errors but it wasn't operating to what I expected. AI has helped bridge the gap, versus searching hours upon hours
  in how to fix an issue while having no clue what the actual problem. AI has enhanced the way I think of a problem but there are points when Ai is wrong and you 
  need to discover the issue on your own. We can Use AI as a tool but nothing more. We cannot let our own knowledge and skills deter us from continuing to learn
  but as another option to help us become better software developers. 
</p></br>
<h1>IV. Practical Application</h1></br>
<p>
 AI has become so advanced, They are able to create stories, music, art. Software Engineers have pushed for the impossible and becosue of that ambition
  we are moving to another era of new age tech, that can simulate talents that people strived for my years but now can do with a click of button. Beforehand, we believed
  That Ai was meant for robots and commands, but now the train of thought has simulated how people see the world.
