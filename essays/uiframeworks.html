<h1>User Interface Frameworks</h1>
<p>
User-interface frameworks like bootstrap 5 has pre-built GUI element tools. Some of these elements include, Buttons, Toggles, Drop Downs, Re-sizing of fonts, Links and many other functions that can help with front-end development. Programmers has accessability, functionality and flexibility when creating with UI frameworks. Most customizations can be done in a html file. which makes thing much simplier, instead of bouncing between a CSS style file and HTML. Although, the biggest hurdle a programmer or software develop must overcome is the learning curve for using UI frameworks. Bootstrap5 is a completely different language in comparison to object oriented programing though much easier in retrospec due to how it's usage. The way to use bootstrap5 is to call it in "head" so that it is accessible in "body" of the html file. When bootstrap 5 installed, the developer can begin creating projects. The setup for the UI is a bit tedious if there is no reference in finding the links to input in the html file but overall when using the UI framework, there is a massive difference in how unique the website could look and function in comparison when using raw HTML and CSS together.

<p>
  Initally when learning the use Bootstrap5, The amount of time to learn how to use each GUI option and how it the program interacts with the website was difficult. And currently still difficult. Ideally, the best way to learn to use user-interface frameworks is practice. and making sure that everything is contained correctly. There can be confusion when your using mulitple rows and column within the "div" or division and sometimes you can lose track or miss and ending marker. immediately when observing the website a programmer built, someonce or a co-worker can tell if something is not in order in the code. since the code would reflect how the front-end would appear. A problem a ran into constantly when attempting to re-create a website is making sure I use classes correctly. If using CSS, you would need to reference what you labeled in html to update the look of the type or color. It's important to pay attention when changing the code. because it can get confusing when you are constantly adding something to class.

<p>
  The biggest differences between UI frameworks and using RAW HTML file is the amount of time it takes. In comparison, It would take a large amount of time to learn to use bootstrap 6 because of the how the code "wraps" it together along with the amount of code to make changes to the acutal user interface. While raw html and css, would take maybe double amount of time to create something on a similar level to something that was created in bootstrap5. Using raw html and css is easier in my opinion but the ability to edit and the flexability of ui frameworks is much stronger in comparison when making the same website. Programmers at some point, would be frustrated in how tedious bootstrap5 could be but the time effeciency outweight the amount of time to make a raw html and css due to micromanaging everything in style.css and index.html. To save time and having more editing power. using userinterfaces is the way to go.
