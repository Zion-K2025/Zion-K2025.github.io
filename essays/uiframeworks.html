<title>UI framweworks and the Differences between RAW HTML and CSS</title>
<h1>User Interface Frameworks</h1>
<h1>
  UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Bootstrap 5? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?
</h1>
<p>
User-interface frameworks like bootstrap 5 has pre-built GUI element tools. Some of these elements include, Buttons, Toggles, Drop Downs, Re-sizing of fonts, Links and many other functions that can help with front-end development. Programmers has accessability, functionality and flexibility when creating with UI frameworks. Most customizations can be done in a html file. which makes thing much simplier, instead of bouncing between a CSS style file and HTML. Although, the biggest hurdle a programmer or software develop must overcome is the learning curve for using UI frameworks. Bootstrap5 is a completely different language in comparison to object oriented programing though much easier in retrospec due to how it's usage. The way to use bootstrap5 is to call it in "head" so that it is accessible in "body" of the html file. When bootstrap 5 installed, the developer can begin creating projects. The setup for the UI is a bit tedious if there is no reference in finding the links to input in the html file but overall when using the UI framework, there is a massive difference in how unique the website could look and function in comparison when using raw HTML and CSS together.

  Initally when learning the use Bootstrap5, The amount of time to learn how to use each GUI option and how it the program interacts with the website was difficult. And currently still difficult. Ideally, the best way to learn to use user-interface frameworks is practice. and making sure that everything is contained correctly. There can be confusion when your using mulitple rows and column within the "div" or division and sometimes you can lose track or miss and ending marker. immediately when observing the website a programmer built, someonce or a co-worker can tell if something is not in order in the code. since the code would reflect how the front-end would appear. A problem a ran into constantly when attempting to re-create a website is making sure I use classes correctly. If using CSS, you would need to reference what you labeled in html to update the look of the type or color. It's important to pay attention when changing the code. because it can get confusing when you are constantly adding something to class.
