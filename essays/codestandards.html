Coding Standards and The Approach to Clean Programing<br/>
<br/>
Previously, My 314 class learned Type Script programing through a online editor "TypeScript Playground"<br/>
This week, we moved into a open source editor called VS code. Immediately, I noticed a difference between<br/>
the two. TypeScript Playground has a built in compiler, flexible when inputing data, and much easier to<br/>
navigate. In comparison, When initially setting up the IDE for visual studios, there are many additional steps<br/>
to write in TypeSCript. It is required to add Extensions to the environment. Those Extensions being:<br/>
<br/>
ESLint: Program structure format<br/>
HTML Boilerplate: HTML template<br/>
HTML CSS Support: User Interface customizations for HTML<br/>
And other extensions added to the environment<br/>
<br/>
After the extensions were initialzied, I attempted to use Visual Studios. Unfortunately, I ran into a problem<br/>
when I tried to use ESLint. In the terminal, to check for errors with ESLint, I had to use command "npm install" <br/>
the npm did not read in the terminal as an active part of extension. For a couple of hourse, I researched to remedy<br/>
the issue. I looked through Stack Overflow, Chat GPT, and any youtube vidoe that can help me use npm on VS code<br/>
I realized a bit late that I needed to instal Node.js, after installation everything seemed to work in order.<br/>
<br/>
As I began to work on my typescript homework, there were some noticeable differences. While TypeScript playground was<br/>
a lot faster to compile and show the partial errors, VS code gives suggestion for quick fixes. An example being, indent errors<br/>
or missing semi-colons. If there is a larger error, it would list in the enviroment a link, although some of those links<br/>
will not guarantee compile erros if the code is wrong. VS code is a bit different, especially with coding standards but a benefit<br/>
to structured coding keeps everything neat. When dealing with code from other developers, if their code is unorganized and not noted<br/>
correctly for proper explanations, it would take more time to complete an assignment. ES lint is helpful tool when fixing errors<br/>
It great added benefit when using type script while making sure when transfering it to JS the the code is clean and excutable.<br/>
