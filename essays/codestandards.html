Coding Standards and The Approach to Clean Programing<br/>
<br/>
Previously, My 314 class learned Type Script programing through a online editor "TypeScript Playground"<br/>
This week, we moved into a open source editor called VS code. Immediately, I noticed a difference between<br/>
the two. TypeScript Playground has a built in compiler, flexible when inputing data, and much easier to<br/>
navigate. In comparison, When initially setting up the IDE for visual studios, there are many additional steps<br/>
to write in TypeSCript. It is required to add Extensions to the environment. Those Extensions being:<br/>
<br/>
ESLint: Program structure format<br/>
HTML Boilerplate: HTML template<br/>
HTML CSS Support: User Interface customizations for HTML<br/>
And other extensions added to the environment<br/>
<br/>
After the extensions were initialzied, I attempted to use Visual Studios. Unfortunately, I ran into a problem<br/>
when I tried to use ESLint. In the terminal, to check for errors with ESLint, I had to use command "npm install" <br/>
