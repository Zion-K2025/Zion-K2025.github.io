Coding Standards and The Approach to Clean Programing
<br/>
Previously, My 314 class learned Type Script programing through a online editor "TypeScript Playground"<br/>
This week, we moved into a open source editor called VS code. Immediately, I noticed a difference between<br/>
the two. TypeScript Playground has a built in compiler, flexible when inputing data, and much easier to<br/>
navigate. In comparison, When initially setting up the IDE for visual studios, there are many additional steps<br/>
to write in TypeSCript. IT is required to add Extensions to the environment. Those Extensions being:<br/>
<br/>
ESLint: Program structure format<br/>
HTML Boilerplate: HTML template<br/>
HTML CSS Support: User Interface customizations for HTML<br/>
And other extensions added to the environment<br/>


<br/>

When asking for help or assistance, it is critical to ask consice and clear questions when explaining the problem, especially in test phases or when bugs arise in the code. Smart questions helps with determing specific issues. It cuts down the amount of time by skipping the generalizations and help pinpointing what actually needs to be addressed. No software engineer wants to go through open ended problems, taking a large amount of time just to figure out what is the issue that needs to be addressed. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**What is an example of a smart question?**
<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example from Stack overflow
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The developer is having issues with Git because of a macOS update.
<br/>
<br/>
The developer experienced an error message:
<br/>
<br/>
**“xcrun: error: invalid active developer path”(/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools)**
<br/>
<br/>
Developer states after the MacOS update he navigated through his companie’s codebase in the command line to check “git status” in the repository which recieved the invalid active developer path error message. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was an update to the error which was shared to the forum, “missing xcrun” at location (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The developer summarized the question: How to fix git and the command line tools?
<br/>
<br/>
**""Link(stackoverflow)-https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52522565/git-is-not-working-after-macos-update-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-p/52522566#52522566""**
<br/>
<br/>
I noticed each response were similar in how to fix the git error. “By updating X-code comman line” The reason he had a thorough<br/> response, is because he asked a thorough question, explaining the details of what happened, what changed, and the type of computer the developer has. He eliminated any open questions to the problem and hyperfocused on the particular bug that was happening in git. 
<br/>
<br/>
As programmers and software engineers, communication should be excuted in similar fashion to better insure quick response and effiecent formating of the problem at hand, so the co-worker that is helping or the developer giving the help can give more concrete answers instead of searching aimlessly for the problem. 
<br/>
<br/>
**What is an example of a non-smart question?**
<br/>
<br/>
An example of not-smart question is the oppoite of the what is considered smart. Simply saying, “my code doesn’t work, help!” will not show any revelance to the actual problem. It will cause confusion and waste the needed time to finish the project or task that was given to others.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An example of this, comes from another Stack overflow submission.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A student posted a comment in Stack overflow with the tittle, “C File Homework”<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And proceeded to copy and paste the code, which caused some confusion within the responses. Granted the developers answered to the best of their ability with possible solutions. But, the overall response was negative, since copy and pasting a problem without any information will attract unhelpful responses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**conclusion** 
<br/>
<br/>
From my understanding, smart questions is essential for effiency and clarity. This does not just apply to the software engineering field but to any job or classroom a person undergoes. Clearly identifying problems and explaing the steps that were taken, the things that were attempted to solve said problem, time stamped updates, and useful information is useful.
