<title>UI framweworks and the Differences between RAW HTML and CSS</title>
<h1>User Interface Frameworks</h1>
<h1>
  UI Frameworks are not simple. In fact, they can be almost as complicated to learn as a new programming language. Given that, why bother to use something like Bootstrap 5? What does one get in return for the investment of time and frustration? Why not just use raw HTML and CSS? Are the software engineering benefits of UI frameworks?
</h1>
<p>
User-interface frameworks like bootstrap 5 has pre-built GUI element tools. Some of these elements include, Buttons, Toggles, Drop Downs, Re-sizing of fonts, Links and many other functions that can help with front-end development. Programmers has accessability, functionality and flexibility when creating with UI frameworks. Most customizations can be done in a html file. which makes thing much simplier, instead of bouncing between a CSS style file and HTML. Although, the biggest hurdle a programmer or software develop must overcome is the learning curve for using UI frameworks. Bootstrap5 is a completely different language in comparison to object oriented programing though much easier in retrospec due to how it's usage. The way to use bootstrap5 is to call it in "head" so that it is accessible in "body" of the html file. When bootstrap 5 installed, the developer can begin creating projects. The setup for the UI is a bit tedious if there is no reference in finding the links to input in the html file but overall when using the UI framework, there is a massive difference in how unique the website could look and function in comparison when using raw HTML and CSS together.
