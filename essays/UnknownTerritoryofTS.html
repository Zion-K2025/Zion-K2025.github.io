My first experience with TypeScript came from one of my computer science college courses called ICS 212 Software 
Engineering. Unlike JavaScript, I received a crash course through the free coding tutorials, Free Code Camp. I have worked 
with couple different languages that held similar properties to one another and some that were completely different. Some 
languages being JavaScript, C++, and Python. 


With any new language there is a feeling of unknown territory. The technical terminology that descripes TypeScript explains the language as a superset of JavaScript that allows both dynamic and Static typing. In other words, There was a feeling of apprehension due to my non-experience this new coding process. TypeScript, like in it’s name, uses a lot of basic types. Initially, it was hard to break certain habits due to feelings more comfortable with a different coding language, but as I practiced the homeworks and the WOD(Work out of the Day) provided from our professor, it became much easier. 


From my experience, Type Script felt much more flexible. The creation of functions was straight forward possibly due TypeScript’s ability to do both Dynamic and Static typing. With programing Languages like JavaScript and C++ it felt stiff and bit harder to navigate when a student initally begins learning computer science. Both have their own pros and cons, but I feel it would be benificial to learn TypeScript alongside JavaScript, since both correlate with each other. 


The workout of the day is critical in helping build quick experience when learning something new like TypeScript. Being timed during the WODs is stressful due to feeling the pressure to perform adequately.
