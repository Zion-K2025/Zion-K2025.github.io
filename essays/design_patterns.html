<h1>1. Overview </h1>
<p>
Design patterns are re-usable code or solutions that can be re-cycled into a different way. 
Whether it's using Java to create back end code for a menu option or front end development
to create a website for functionality. Many patterns occur due how easily the code can be used.
In my university class 211, we learned the usage of linked list. The idea is to create new nodes 
and linked them together so it's easily traversed when trying to find a specific type of data.
Linked List can be used in many different ways. Binary Trees, Queues, and stacks. Ideally we can
re-use code from the linked list and use them in these different ways. Instead creating code from scratch
I can reference the code that is already built and operable.

During this 314 class we have created mock websites and currently creating a useable app. The code that
has been used, were referenced off from a different homework assignment. Inspiration was drawn from the
island Snow react project or the WODs that put are work into practice. These are some examples that
has been used as a template to help provide a working guideline.
