<h1>1. Overview </h1>
<p>
Design patterns are re-usable code or solutions that can be re-cycled into a different way.</br> 
Whether it's using Java to create back end code for a menu option or front end development </br>
to create a website for functionality. Many patterns occur due how easily the code can be used. </br>
In my university class 211, we learned the usage of linked list. The idea is to create new nodes </br> 
and linked them together so it's easily traversed when trying to find a specific type of data. </br>
Linked List can be used in many different ways. Binary Trees, Queues, and stacks. Ideally we can </br>
re-use code from the linked list and use them in these different ways. Instead creating code from scratch </br>
I can reference the code that is already built and operable. </br>

During this 314 class we have created mock websites and currently creating a useable app. The code that </br>
has been used, were referenced off from a different homework assignment. Inspiration was drawn from the </br>
island Snow react project or the WODs that put are work into practice. These are some examples that </br>
has been used as a template to help provide a working guideline.  </br>
</p>
 </br>

Currently, I'm working with a team, that is creating a Next.js project called Study Palz. The project is an  </br>
interactive way to connect students to have a better understanding of the subject that they are studying. In </br>
Particular computer science. The part of the project that I have been working on is the Calendar. The user  </br>
will schedule times that they will meet with another student to meet up for the study group. One of the bigger </br>
issues I had while working on this project was to determine how to create the schedule froms scratch. I made many  </br>
attempts to create one but I realized that using pre-made templates would help the development. I used existing designs </br>
to create my own version of the calender.  </br>

The main benefit for design patterns is the functionality. The software engineer would know that the code will work. The  </br>
only hurdle they need to overcome is how to impliment the code within their own design. More than likely more than  </br>
one developer can recognize the pattern that is being formed and if needed the developer can modify it, so it can better </br>
work for their own needs. Reusing Code also efficient. Perhaps the template is much cleaner and smaller in complexity so it can </br>
be used with large issues. There are many different type of design patterns, some being creational, structural and behavorial.  </br>
We use these methods, sometimes, without even noticing. </br>

The biggest take away that I can offer is to work smarter not harder. If we work efficiently to better our own projects by </br>
observing patterns we can make life as coder, more easier.  </br>
