<h1>1. Overview </h1>
<p>
Design patterns are re-usable code or solutions that can be re-cycled into a different way. 
Whether it's using Java to create back end code for a menu option or front end development
to create a website for functionality. Many patterns occur due how easily the code can be used.
In my university class 211, we learned the usage of linked list. The idea is to create new nodes 
and linked them together so it's easily traversed when trying to find a specific type of data.
Linked List can be used in many different ways. Binary Trees, Queues, and stacks. Ideally we can
re-use code from the linked list and use them in these different ways. Instead creating code from scratch
I can reference the code that is already built and operable.

During this 314 class we have created mock websites and currently creating a useable app. The code that
has been used, were referenced off from a different homework assignment. Inspiration was drawn from the
island Snow react project or the WODs that put are work into practice. These are some examples that
has been used as a template to help provide a working guideline.

Currently, I'm working with a team, that is creating a Next.js project called Study Palz. The project is an 
interactive way to connect students to have a better understanding of the subject that they are studying. In
Particular computer science. The part of the project that I have been working on is the Calendar. The user 
will schedule times that they will meet with another student to meet up for the study group. One of the bigger
issues I had while working on this project was to determine how to create the schedule froms scratch. I made many 
attempts to create one but I realized that using pre-made templates would help the development. I used existing designs
to create my own version of the calender. 

The main benefit for design patterns is the functionality. The software engineer would know that the code will work. The 
only hurdle they need to overcome is how to impliment the code within their own design. More than likely more than 
one developer can recognize the pattern that is being formed and if needed the developer can modify it, so it can better
work for their own needs. Reusing Code also efficient. Perhaps the template is much cleaner and smaller in complexity so it can
be used with large issues. There are many different type of design patterns, some being creational, structural and behavorial. 
We use these methods, sometimes, without even noticing. 

The biggest take away that I can offer is to work smarter not harder. If we work efficiently to better our own projects by
observing patterns we can make life as coder, more easier.
