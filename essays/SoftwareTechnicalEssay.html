I always had an interest in STEM , in otherwords Science. Previously I was a Mechanical Engineering major. I started at University of Hawaii at Hilo and it was required to take a computer science class. My professor at the time noticed that I was decent in programming. He suggested I switch over to computer science since but decided to stick out engineering. Fast forward a couple years later, I switched over to CS. During my major switch I did some research in different fields of computer science. Data Science, Cyber Security, Software Development, Software Engineering.  Initially, I looked at coding, Similar how the rest of the world looked at it. A hacker, that wore a hoodie, that is able to tap his keyboard with quick accuracy. The matrix symbols rolling down the display as said person hacked some random agency. But as I looked a little deeper and practiced my own programing skills. I realized that there is a lot more to computer science that meets the eye.

In a way, Softwre Engineering is an art form. Although there is a technical aspect to these skills, I noticed the power of those who can imagine and replicate that inside of a computer. I have always been a gaming nerd. I enjoyed the aspects of how the visual layout of games throughout the years, increasingly becoming better overtime. Itâ€™s inspiring to see developers in their field, increase their knowledge and pioneered new worlds that we read in books or movies. The creation of interactive characters and new places was due to a team of engineers and developers that wanted to tell a story but in a different way. I believe that what drew me into the computer science field, especially in software development and engineering. Video games did play a roll in these decision when I switched my major but I believe my reason for becoming a student in computer science is because I enjoy creating things and problem solving.

I hope during this class, ICS 314, I am able to develop and strengthen my programing skills and eventually use the things that I learned into a future career path. There are many different types of computer science, Software engineering being one of them. Understandably, this course and major are difficult, But I am determined to learn and grow from this experience of this class. Hopefully, I can look back on my time in ICS 314 and be proud how far I come.
